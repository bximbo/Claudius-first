# Claudius-first
A merge between two samples from Claudius-examples( day1 & day2) with 72% lot of tweaking 

**Changes made to get here** 
1. The rings around the orbit are not just constrained to the sphere but now also spins about y-axis
2. Without adding a new buffer, the dynamic plasma background shares the same pixel spaces while updating the background after the fading effect

Finally got it to do exactly what I wantedðŸš€

Please to acess file, just clone the "first" file to your already developed Claudius envronment
